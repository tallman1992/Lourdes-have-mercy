<h1>Lourdes Have Mercy</h1>
<h2>World Cup Round 1 recap</h2>
<span>Story by Matt Rickard</span>

<section class="start content">

  <h2></h2>

<hr>
  <p>In this town known for its miracles, the only holy water in sight was falling from the sky to create one of the rowdiest opening World Cup rounds we've seen in years.</p>

  <p>Though the track remained completely unchanged from its debute last season, the conditions made it anything but the same. With rain falling heavily each night and intermittently through the day, the track was in a constant state of flux. </p>

<p>With each passing run things changed and just as riders began to feel comfortbale, or things began to dry up, the heavens opened up to wipe the slate clean and send everyone back to the drawing board.
 <p> Just when the riders thought the track would show some mercy, it goes and does the complete oppsoite.

  <h1>The Setting</h1>
</header>
</section>

<section class="content">
<HR>
<p>Lourdes is a small town situated in the foothills of the Pyranees in South-West France. In 1858 Lourdes rose to prominence in France and abroad due to the Marian apparitions seen by the peasant girl Bernadette Soubirous, who was later canonized. </p>
<p> Shortly thereafter the city became one of the world's most important sites of pilgrimage and religious tourism. Today Lourdes hosts around six million visitors every year from all corners of the world. This constant stream of pilgrims and tourists transformed quiet Lourdes into the second most important center of tourism in France, second only to Paris, and the third most important site of international Catholic pilgrimage after Rome and the Holy Land.  </p>

<p>The Lourdes WC track is one of the most technical and challenging on the circuit. Having broken through onto the scene in 2015, the track offers an array of difficult obstacles, pushing riders to their absolute limits. It is for this reason the venue is now a favourite amongst riders. </p>

    With heavy rain on the night before practice riders were eagerly anticipating the greasy track that lay before them. With mud tires on, suspension re-dialled and mechanics briefed, the only thing left to do was grin and bear the beast 1000 feet above.

  </p>

<p> The first half of the day saw sunny skies, making for a quickly drying track. But as predicted, the heavens opened later in the afternoon, quashing any hope of a dry qualification run the following day. </p>

<section class= "content">
<p> Loic Bruni showed just why he is in the rainbow stripes in qualification. While most others fought hard to navigate the track, the Frenchman seemed to hover and skip across the muck and the rocks. Loic qualified almost six seconds up on the rest of the field. Aaron Gwin, the man who dominated Lourdes last year found himself in tenth after a crash. Josh Bryceland was second followed by Gee Atherton around a second back. Qualification also saw Steve Smith looking back to brilliance, and Brendan Fairclough continued the fine form he concluded last year with. Loris Vergier had an incredible ride even with a tumble. Most riders didn't make it down without incident. All seemed to come across the line with a smear of Lourdes wet soil on them somewhere.
<p> Tahnee Seagrave came out swinging like an angry nun with a finish at the top spot after suffering a quick off. World Champ Rachel Atherton came in second three seconds back and Manon Carpenter took third. The Junior men's top spot was taken by privateer Frenchman, Kevin Marry. British lads, Matt Walker and Charlie Hatton took second and third. Top junior, Jackson Frew, took fifth today.With Weather looking like it might be on the up for the finals, riders were looking at being able to put more on the line rather than trying to just make it down safe.
